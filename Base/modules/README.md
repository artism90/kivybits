# screen

Added support for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.

To activate it, use one of the following execution lines when initiating your kivy app:
> main.py -m screen:s7edge,portrait,scale=.30

Or:

> main.py -m screen:s7edge,landscape,scale=.30

If there's a larger display screen available, a higher scaling may be appropriate as well.
